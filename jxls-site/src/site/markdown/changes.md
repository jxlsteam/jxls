###### Compatibility notes and future plans
* Signature of createTransformer() has been changed. The throws has been removed. Now the unchecked CannotOpenWorkbookException will be thrown.
* jx:each and jx:grid now treat null lists as empty lists (see [issue#200](https://bitbucket.org/leonate/jxls/issues/200/treat-null-in-eachcommand-items-as-empty) )
* POI 4.0 requires Java 8 and so it is the recommended version to use. JXLS code base will be migrated to Java 8 syntax in the upcoming versions.
* The major change in 2.9.0 will be the move to Github. Our homepage and publishing to Maven-central will stay the same.

* [Free rows when 2 adjacent collections](https://bitbucket.org/leonate/jxls/issue/4/free-rows-when-2-adjacent-collections)


v2.0.0
------
First public release for Jxls-2.

Jxls-2 is a full rewrite from scratch of the original [Jxls 1.x](http://jxls.sf.net/1.x) library to make it much more flexible and improve the performance.

Jxls-2 completely de-couples itself from the underlying Java-to-Excel transformation engine so that it is possible to switch low-level Java-to-Excel library without any code changes.

Excel template markup can now be redefined in a way you like.

Jxls-2 introduces a concept of [Command](reference/command.html) to replace previously used tags (like *jx:forEach*, *jx:if*).
[Command](reference/command.html) is not tied to any particular Excel mark-up. In fact it can be defined completely in Java or by using built-in Excel-comment or XML-based mark-ups.

Custom post- and pre- processing code can now also be easily injected into Excel transformation.

Please note that Jxls-2 is not backwards compatible with Jxls 1.x.

If you wish to upgrade your existing Jxls 1.x reports for Jxls-2 you will have to rewrite the code and change the notation in XLS template.
