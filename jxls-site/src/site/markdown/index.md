Jxls 2.14.0 is released!
============================

* This is the last Java 8 release.
* [#251 lastCommentedColumn not necessary anymore](https://github.com/jxlsteam/jxls/issues/251)<br/>**Breaking change:** You just have to remove calls to setLastCommentedColumn() and everything works.
* [#271 fix: memory leak in streaming Excel processing](https://github.com/jxlsteam/jxls/issues/271) *- Thanks to giuseppemilicia*

Introduction
------------
Jxls is a small Java library to make generation of Excel reports easy.
Jxls uses a special markup in Excel templates to define output formatting and data layout.

Excel generation is required in many Java applications that have some kind of reporting functionality.

Java has a few libraries for creating Excel files e.g. [Apache POI](https://poi.apache.org/).

Those libraries are great but quite low-level as they require a developer to write a lot of Java code even to create a simple Excel file.

Usually one has to manually set each cell formatting and data for the spreadsheet.
Depending on the complexity of the report layout and data formatting the Java code can become quite complex and difficult to debug and maintain.

In addition not all Excel features are supported and can be manipulated with libraries API (e.g. limited support for macros, graphs etc).
The suggested workaround for unsupported features is to create an object manually in an Excel template  and fill in the template with data after that. Jxls takes this approach to a higher level. 

When working with Jxls one just needs to define the required report formatting and data layout in an Excel template file and then run Jxls engine
 to fill in the template with data. A developer needs to write just a little bit of Java code to trigger Jxls engine processing of the template.
