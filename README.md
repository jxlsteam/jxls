## News

JXLS has moved from BitBucket to Github. Please use the Github issue tracker.

## Overview

JXLS (see [homepage](http://jxls.sourceforge.net/)) is a small and simple to use Java library for Excel report generation using Excel template files.

JXLS abstracts Excel generation from underlying Java-to-Excel low-level processing library.
JXLS uses a special markup in Excel templates to define output formatting and data layout.
